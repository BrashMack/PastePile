  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "paste"=>{"content"=>"Задача: Домашнее задание\r\n(Время: 1 сек. Память: 16 Мб Сложность: 27%)\r\n\r\nПетя успевает по математике лучше всех в классе, поэтому учитель задал ему сложное домашнее задание, в котором нужно в заданном наборе целых чисел найти сумму всех положительных элементов, затем найти где в заданной последовательности находятся максимальный и минимальный элемент и вычислить произведение чисел, расположенных в этой последовательности между ними. Так же известно, что минимальный и максимальный элемент встречаются в заданном множестве чисел только один раз и не являются соседними. Поскольку задач такого рода учитель дал Пете около ста, то Петя как сильный программист смог написать программу, которая по заданному набору чисел самостоятельно находит решение. А Вам слабо?\r\n\r\nВходные данные:\r\nВ первой строке входного файла INPUT.TXT записано единственное число N – количество элементов массива. Вторая строка содержит N целых чисел, представляющих заданный массив. Все элементы массива разделены пробелом. Каждое из чисел во входном файле, в том числе и N, не превышает 10^2 по абсолютной величине.\r\n\r\nВыходные данные:\r\nВ единственную строку выходного файла OUTPUT.TXT нужно вывести два числа, разделенных пробелом: сумму положительных элементов и произведение чисел, расположенных между минимальным и максимальным элементами.

Память: 16 Мб Сложность: 27%)\r\n\r\nПетя успевает по математике лучше всех в классе, поэтому учитель задал ему сложное домашнее задание, в котором нужно в заданном наборе целых чисел найти сумму всех положительных элементов, затем найти где в заданной последовательности находятся максимальный и минимальный элемент и вычислить произведение чисел, расположенных в этой последовательности между ними. Так же известно, что минимальный и максимальный элемент встречаются в заданном множестве чисел только один раз и не являются соседними. Поскольку задач такого рода учитель дал Пете около ста, то Петя как сильный программист смог написать программу, которая по заданному набору чисел самостоятельно находит решение. А Вам слабо?\r\n\r\nВходные данные:\r\nВ первой строке входного файла INPUT.TXT записано единственное число N – количество элементов массива.

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "paste"=>{"content"=>"ЗАДАЧА №9 \t\t\r\n\t\r\nДомашнее задание\r\n(Время: 1 сек. Память: 16 Мб Сложность: 27%)\r\nПетя успевает по математике лучше всех в классе, поэтому учитель задал ему сложное домашнее задание, в котором нужно в заданном наборе целых чисел найти сумму всех положительных элементов, затем найти где в заданной последовательности находятся максимальный и минимальный элемент и вычислить произведение чисел, расположенных в этой последовательности между ними. Так же известно, что минимальный и максимальный элемент встречаются в заданном множестве чисел только один раз и не являются соседними. Поскольку задач такого рода учитель дал Пете около ста, то Петя как сильный программист смог написать программу, которая по заданному набору чисел самостоятельно находит решение. А Вам слабо?\r\n\r\nВходные данные:\r\nВ первой строке входного файла INPUT.TXT записано единственное число N – количество элементов массива. Вторая строка содержит N целых чисел, представляющих заданный массив. Все элементы массива разделены пробелом. Каждое из чисел во входном файле, в том числе и N, не превышает 10^2 по абсолютной величине.\r\n\r\nВыходные данные:\r\nВ единственную строку выходного файла OUTPUT.TXT нужно вывести два числа, разделенных пробелом: сумму положительных элементов и произведение чисел, расположенных между минимальным и максимальным элементами. Значения суммы и произведения не превышают по модулю 3*10^4. \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                    РЕШЕНИЕ:\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <algorithm>\r\nusing namespace std;\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int N, * a, x = -10000, y = 10000, maxi(0), mini(0), sum = 0, mult = 1;\r\n    cin >> N;\r\n    a = new int[N];\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        cin >> a[i];\r\n    }\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        if (a[i] > x)\r\n        {\r\n            x = a[i];\r\n            maxi = i;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        if (a[i] < y)\r\n        {\r\n            y = a[i];\r\n            mini = i;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        if (a[i] > 0) sum += a[i];\r\n    }\r\n    for (int i = min(mini, maxi) + 1; i < max(maxi, mini); i++)\r\n    {\r\n        mult *= a[i];\r\n    }\r\n    cout << sum << \" \" << mult;\r\n    return 0;\r\n}", "name"=>"Задача по C++", "language"=>"cpp", "private"=>"0"}, "commit"=>"Подтвердить", "id"=>"4"}
